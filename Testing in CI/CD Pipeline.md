RESUME :

1. Continuous Integration is the practice of integrating code into a shared repository and building/testing each change automatically, as early as possible, usually several times a day. 

2. Continous Delivery adds that the software can be released to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system. 

Continuous Deployment goes further and pushes changes to production automatically. 

3. CI/CD Process 
Commit - Build - Test - Deploy 

Benefits of implementing CI 

- Detecting bug in early stage 
- Reduces bug count 
- Development Process more transparent 
- Efficient
